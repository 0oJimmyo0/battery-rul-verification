; VNNLIB for cycle monotonicity verification with smaller input range
; Input: cycle
(declare-const X_0 Real)

; Output: RUL
(declare-const Y_0 Real)

; Input bounds: cycle in [50.0, 150.0]
(assert (<= X_0 150.0))
(assert (>= X_0 50.0))

; Output constraint: RUL >= 0 (non-negativity)
(assert (>= Y_0 0.0))
